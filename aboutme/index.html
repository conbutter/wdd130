    <h2><b>Connor Butterfield</b></h2>
    <p>Good morning, afternoon, evening, or whatever time you're reading this! I'm Connor,
        and I'm happy you came to my nice little webpage. I'm from the humid, hot state of<br>
        Florida, pretty close to Orlando. I'm currently majoring in Web Design and Development,
        to learn even moreabout how user interface can impact experience! Design is very, <br>VERY
        interesting to me- trying to figure out how users will interact with the things we create
        is imperative to building and maintaining well-designed and easy-to-use websites<br> and systems. </p>
    <p>I love creating things- pretty much everything, actually! Music, games, videos, graphics, 
        even digital recreations of entertainment venues and theme parks- you name it,<br> I've
        likely dabbled a bit into it. I feel learning more about the web and how we interact with it is
        critical as our world heavily relies upon websites and the systems designed around them.
    <br> I'm also obsessed with games- board games, video games- but not mind games. Let's make that
distinction pretty clear here.</p>
    <p>I grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and served in the Utah
        Provo Mission. I would not be the person who I am today without my Savior and<br> Heavenly
        Father, and I feel my desire to create is a gift and an invitation from them to
        make things that others can resonate with. if there's anything all of my<br> work is
        centralized around, it's trying to help others feel joy, inspiration, or hope from
        the things I make- and hopefully, this semester, I can hone my skills <br>to get even
        better at that.</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture of all time is Alma 26:27, which states "Now when our hearts were
        depressed, and we were about to aturn back, behold, the Lord comforted us,<br> and said:
        Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and
        I will give unto you success." This scripture gives me hope that,<br> as long as I have
        the desire, He will give me the strength to keep moving forward.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to read about me!</p>
    <p>Until next time...</p>
