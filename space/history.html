            <div class='history-info'>
                <p>The concept for Space Mountain, one of Disney's most iconic attractions,
                    can traced back to the 1950s and Walt Disney's interest in space exploration.
                    He was captivated by the Space Age and the emerging interest in space travel
                    during that era, and after the opening of the Matterhorn Bobsleds at his California
                    Disneyland park, Walt knew coasters had a place at his park. This fascination with space
                    led to the idea of a space-themed  roller coaster- one that wouldn't be very different
                    from the Space Mountain we know of today. However, Walt wouldn't get to realize
                    this concept in his lifetime, but after Disney World opened in 1971, his Imagineers
                    knew how to move forward.</p>
                <p>In order to design the coaster, the Imagineers partnered with Arrow Dynamics- a 
                    popular and well-experienced coaster manufacturer. The design and development of Space
                    Mountain were complex and ambitious. Originally, Space Mountain consisted of four seperate
                    coasters in one white, glossy mountain-shaped style building, with coaster track flowing
                    in and outside of the structure- but it would eventually be resized to contain just two 
                    mirrored tracks, placed side-by-side to each other, allowing for two different experiences
                    in the same coaster. The exterior of the building itself was designed to resemble a
                    futuristic spaceport, enhancing the immersive experience. The coaster was
                    also innovative in that it featured a tubular steel track, a relatively
                    new technology at the time, which allowed for smoother
                    and more dynamic ride experiences. Not only that, but Space Mountain would become
                    first theme park attraction to entirely be operated by a computer- allowing for easier
                    and smoother operations. RCA, the electronics company, would sponsor the attraction and put up
                    half of the necessary $20 million needed to construct it.</p>

                <p>Construction of Space Mountain presented its own unique challenges. Building an
                    indoor coaster within the constraints of the theme park was a monumental task.
                    The massive dome-shaped structure was constructed, which would house the coaster
                    and create a sense of traveling through the cosmos. The coaster's track was
                    carefully laid out inside the building, which featured special lighting effects
                    to create the illusion of stars and other celestial elements. The ride's complex
                    infrastructure and layout made it a true engineering marvel.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the ride was finished and was ready for the public. 
                    The first Space Mountain opened at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom
                    in Orlando, Florida, on January 15, 1975. The attraction's official opening was a grand
                    event, and thousands of guests would flock to the park and the ride to experience it
                    for themselves. It quickly became one of the most popular rides at Walt Disney World.
                    Visitors were awed by the combination of thrilling twists and turns, the darkness that added an
                    element of mystery, and the exciting sensation of hurtling through space. Space Mountain
                    was an immediate success and set a new standard for theme park attractions. Its
                    innovative design and immersive experience inspired many other theme parks to
                    create their own indoor roller coasters and push the boundaries of theme park technology. 
                    It was a major milestone for Disney and the theme park industry as a whole. </p>
                <p>Ever since 1975, Space Mountain has been delighting and thrilling guests at 
                    the Magic Kingdom. It wouldn't be long, however, until it would start to appear 
                    with various iterations in Disneyland and other Disney resorts across the globe. 
                    The attraction has seen it's fair share of changes and updates since 1975; 
                    updated and enhanced technology as well as special effects would occupy the mountain 
                    over the years, but the core ride experience and concept remains the same to this day. 
                    Space Mountain remains an enduring symbol of Walt Disney's vision for immersive, innovative, 
                    and inspiring theme park experiences. It continues to captivate visitors of all ages 
                    and remains a shining example of Disney's dedication to storytelling and creativity 
                    in the world of theme parks.</p>
