    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to establish a presence for our White Water Rafting company on the World Wide Web,
      which will involve many benefits. Not only will potential customers and groups be able to find us when searching for
      White Water Rafting in their area, they can see pricing, when we are operating, and potentially book voyages online
      or use the information on the site to reach out to us and book a voyage. Overall, our purpose with this site is to share
      information and build revenue.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience are potential customers and owners of groups (schools, families, parties, etc.) who may be interested
      in booking a potential voyage with our company. They want a clear, consise representation of the services and voyages we offer,
      as well as information on how to use them. As a result, information should be formatted and structured in a way
      that makes it clear A) the services we offer and B) the types of bookings and pricings for such voyages. Our goal is for
      potential customers to be able to find our website and, without external help, be able to research and book schedulings using
      the information provided on the website only. The website is likely being visited on typical desktop or laptop setup, so while 
      it's important to make it usuable in Mobile formats, it's not the primary focus.
